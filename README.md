# Set of SQL queries

The projects showcased in my portfolio demonstrate my ability with SQL.

- **Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project SQL**. Changed the date format, transformed the address into individual columns, removed duplicates, deleted unused columns.

- **COVID-19 Rates SQL**. Quantified COVID-19 global data: vaccinations, total infection cases by country, total deaths per continent. Stored data for later visualizations.
